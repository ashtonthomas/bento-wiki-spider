# Hack Project in Java

This is the start of the java hack project.

- Full-stack java-based app
- Web view that accepts a wikipedia url (starting point)
- recursively retrieve the first lowercase link in the main text until the [Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) page is reached
- persist and present the path taken (include datastore)
- handle edge cases or special scenarios
- display sufficient design and organization of application
- will be mostly new technologies and I get to use an IDE again (not even sure what is on my personal computer...)

Technologies to tinker with:
- Spark
- Hibernate
- Angular (1.5)
- MySQL (maybe use an in memory data store or filestore)
- Deploy to Heroku?
